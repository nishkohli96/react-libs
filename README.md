# react-libs

**A sample React-App where I have implemented various react-libraries with code explanations.**

## Important

For development use `tailwind.css` file to add styles.

While building app for production, comment/remove `import tailwind.css` line in `index.js` and uncomment `import index.css` line. Also uncomment the **Purge** option in `tailwind.config.js` will remove all unused styles to give you an optimized css file.
